### About

Hi, I'm little blue. Nice to meet you. This profile is **work in progress**, so do expect to find broken links, blank html files and incomplete README's.

I am a self-taught (have no formal CS education) programmer. I also am completely new to the industry. I am actively looking for a job (Remote, if possible) in Data Science / Machine Learning. If you'd like to try me out, please send me a mail.
