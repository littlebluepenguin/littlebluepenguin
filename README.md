### About

Hi, I'm little blue. Nice to meet you. I'm actively looking for a job -- remote, if possible -- in Data Science / Machine Learning. If you'd like to try me out, please send me a mail.


### Projects
#### Machine Learning
- **[Ion Switching](https://github.com/littlebluepenguin/kaggle/tree/main/Ion%20Switching)**:
A study of the [Ion Switching](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liverpool-ion-switching) Kaggle competition. View the notebooks in a pretty format [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/littlebluepenguin/kaggle/tree/main/Ion%20Switching/). Read about my approach [here](https://littleblue.neocities.org/blog/IonSwitching.html)


### Open Source Contributions
- **[Marlin](https://github.com/wilfredinni/marlin) terminal bookmark manager**: Wrote a small [shell script](https://github.com/wilfredinni/marlin/blob/master/marlin/scripts/marlin.sh) to make Marlin cross-platform and thereby solved an issue
