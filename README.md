### About

Hi, I'm little blue. Nice to meet you. This profile is **work in progress**, so do expect to find broken links, blank web pages and incomplete README's.

I'm a self-taught programmer. I also am completely new to the tech industry. I am actively looking for a job -- remote, if possible -- in Data Science / Machine Learning. If you'd like to try me out, please send me a mail.
